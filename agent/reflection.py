"""Structured post-mortems for every closed position — the self-learning loop,
designed deliberately NOT to be "avoid what lost money."

A strategy with a real, validated edge still loses on a predictable fraction
of its trades — GOOGL cash_secured_put's own backtest win rate is 70%,
meaning 30% of *correctly executed* trades lose. A naive "learn from losses"
loop would spend its entire learning budget trying to unlearn a real edge
based on ordinary variance, which would directly contradict the statistical
discipline this whole project is built on. So this module never grades a
trade by whether it made money. It checks two things instead:

1. Process, not outcome: did entry actually respect what RiskGate is supposed
   to guarantee (backtest-cleared symbol, DTE bounds, position size)? With the
   hard gates in agent/risk/gates.py, this should almost always be clean by
   construction — a flag here means something slipped through, which is the
   actual signal worth surfacing, not "this trade happened to lose."
2. Realized-vs-backtested drift: once there's enough live history, is the
   strategy's live win rate/return still tracking what the backtest predicted,
   or has the edge stopped working? That comparison — not any single trade's
   result — is the statistically honest version of "is this still working."

No fine-tuning happens anywhere here. The summary this module produces is
injected as plain context into the next cycle's prompt (agent/live_agent.py,
agent/live_agent_openai.py, agent/multi_agent.py) — informational continuity,
not a weight update.
